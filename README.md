# RS232-Over-IP

This project was created to aid a long term project I have been working on.  The project involves RS-232 based instrumentation, I need the ability to transmit the instrument output over long distances, (200km+) so IP is the only solution.

The TCP server & client work, the local and remote RS-232 protocols are being worked on.
